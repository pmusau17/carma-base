# This script is meant to generate .gcov files from source code built using code coverage compiler flags
# such that .gcno and .gcda files have been generated
# WARNING this script will remove any .gcov files which currently exist under the output directory argument 2. default=./coverage_reports/gcov/
#
# Parameters
# $1 The execution directory which this script will be run from. Generally this should be the catkin workspace with all source code and binaries below this directory
# $2 The output directory which the .gcov files will be written to
#
#

# Helper function to convert the results of find into a bash array
# This runs on the current directory 
#
# $1 An initialized array
# $2 The regex pattern to find this is passed to the -iname command
# $3 Any additional inputs to find

	local -n ref_array=$1 # Pass the output array by reference
	# Run the find command and store the results in the array
	while IFS=  read -r -d $'\0'; do

	done < <(find . -iname "$2" -print0 $3)
